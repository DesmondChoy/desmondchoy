### Hello, my name is Desmond

I enjoy building and solving problems at the intersection of AI, ML and software engineering. I have strong expertise in LLMs, applied machine learning, sophisticated analytics and visualization.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects Highlights

What I‚Äôve built with Generative AI (so far):
+ [AI voice assistant](https://nbsanity.com/static/1fa0f3c9c93d58847829cbbb8aecde56/ai_insurance_underwriter.html#voice-assistant-prompt) insurance underwriter that offers a fluid life-like conversational experience. The customer‚Äôs transcript (unstructured) can be converted to [structured output](https://nbsanity.com/static/1fa0f3c9c93d58847829cbbb8aecde56/ai_insurance_underwriter.html#llm-prompt) format by passing it to a secondary prompt ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/ai_underwriter))
+ [Condensing long podcasts](https://nbsanity.com/static/07dba1cb4a8538af06b6e05d96878eb3/transcript_summarization_final.html#:~:text=In%20this%20prompt%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20trying%20to%20find%20a%20balance%20%2D%20a%20summary%20yet%20not%20too%20condensed%2C%20since%20a%20final%20summary%20will%20take%20place%20later.) into nuggets of wisdom. Workflow involves splitting text and multi-step prompting ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/podcast_transcript))
+ Implementing [RAG on financial documents](https://nbsanity.com/static/360e99a69f40d828b2f5cf7371072bef/rag.html#question-answering) and evaluating retrieval methods ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/financial_text_rag))

ML end-to-end pipeline: "What Makes A Cup Of Coffee Memorable?"
+ Utilized k-nearest neighbors to impute missing values
+ Engineered new features, trained a LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost model, tuned hyperparameters and selected the best model
+ Test RMSE proved better than training RMSE, indicating no overfitting.
+ Variable importance was analyzed to understand which predictors were relatively more influential in the respective models
