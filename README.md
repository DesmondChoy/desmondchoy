### Hello, my name is Desmond

Data Scientist turned AI engineer, I've expanded my expertise into full-stack AI development, deploying modern apps like [Learning Odyssey](https://learning-odyssey.up.railway.app/), an AI-augmented experience that brings together unlimited dynamic narrative permutations with real-world lessons. 

Key components built with Agentic AI coding tools:

- Event-driven state management that ensures disconnects don't hamper replayability
- Multi-model LLM Orchestration optimized for cost & latency
- Sophisticated prompt engineering that ensures an engaging, captivating storyline
- Visual consistency architecture that preserves character appearance integrity across AI-generated story variations
- Comprehensive observability with structured logging and telemetry (Supabase)
- Authentication flows supporting both OAuth and anonymous users

My multidisciplinary background spanning investment research, telecoms and life insurance has taught me to identify valuable use cases for AI across industries. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI engineering — from building agentic AI systems to creating personalized, adaptive experiences that demonstrate the transformative potential of thoughtfully applied artificial intelligence.

## 🏗️ Projects Highlights

Building GenAI apps to solve real world problems:

+ **Learning Odyssey** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/adventures))  
Need to keep children engaged while learning, but traditional educational apps feel repetitive and boring?  
This AI-powered platform generates unique, interactive adventures where educational content seamlessly integrates into personalized storylines that adapt in real-time to each child's choices.  
Built with a sophisticated Python/FastAPI backend, WebSocket architecture for real-time interactions, and complex state management supporting thousands of narrative permutations while maintaining visual and story consistency throughout the journey.
+ **Multi-Agent Recommender System** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/agents_recsys))  
Looking for specific travel insurance coverage but don't want to painstakingly look through dozens of policies?   
Let a system of agents help you - they work together to provide personalized recommendations based on your requirements.  
Customizable and scalable.
+ **AI Voice Assistant** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/ai_underwriter))  
Have a fluid life-like conversation when buying insurance.  
Customers’ transcript (unstructured) is converted to structured output which can be used for downstream LLM/ML workflows. 
+ **Podcast Summarizer** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/podcast_transcript))  
Too busy to listen to all the interesting podcasts out there?  
Try condensing them into nuggets of wisdom. Utilizes text splitting and multi-step prompting.
+ **Retrieval Augmented Generation** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/financial_text_rag))  
RAG over financial documents. Retrieval methods are evaluated.

**ML end-to-end pipeline**: [What Makes A Cup Of Coffee Memorable?](https://desmondchoy.github.io/r_projects/2020-08-29-predicting-coffee-quality-with-ml.en-us.html)
+ Showcased detailed feature engineering pipeline (thresholding, knn imputing, normalizing, etc)
+ Trained, resampled, and tuned hyperparameters for LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, then evaluating models on test data
+ Utilized variable importance to understand top predictors across models (one of my created feature ranked highest)
