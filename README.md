### Hello, my name is Desmond

I am a Data Science Manager at Pacific Life Re, where I primarily operate as an individual contributor but occasionally help to lead large team projects as scrum master. 

I relish the journey of learning, growing and applying my knowledge in data science, machine learning, and AI to build new tools and explore interesting datasets. Perhaps that's why I'm drawn to both my current field and past (investment research & portfolio management) as they are multidisciplinary in nature.

Off work, I enjoy tinkering with open source tools to build and experiment, as well as exploring unusual datasets. Please refer to Project Highlights below for more details.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects Highlights

Building and Developing with Generative AI:
+ [AI voice assistant](https://nbsanity.com/static/1fa0f3c9c93d58847829cbbb8aecde56/ai_insurance_underwriter.html#voice-assistant-prompt) insurance underwriter that offers a fluid life-like conversational experience. The customer‚Äôs transcript (unstructured) can be converted to [structured output](https://nbsanity.com/static/1fa0f3c9c93d58847829cbbb8aecde56/ai_insurance_underwriter.html#llm-prompt) format by passing it to a secondary prompt ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/ai_underwriter))
+ [Condensing long podcasts](https://nbsanity.com/static/07dba1cb4a8538af06b6e05d96878eb3/transcript_summarization_final.html#:~:text=In%20this%20prompt%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20trying%20to%20find%20a%20balance%20%2D%20a%20summary%20yet%20not%20too%20condensed%2C%20since%20a%20final%20summary%20will%20take%20place%20later.) into nuggets of wisdom. Workflow involves splitting text and multi-step prompting ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/podcast_transcript))
+ Implementing [RAG on financial documents](https://nbsanity.com/static/360e99a69f40d828b2f5cf7371072bef/rag.html#question-answering) and evaluating retrieval methods ([GitHub link](https://github.com/DesmondChoy/financial_text_rag))

ML end-to-end pipeline: ["What Makes A Cup Of Coffee Memorable?"](https://desmondchoy.github.io/r_projects/2020-08-29-predicting-coffee-quality-with-ml.en-us.html)
+ Showcased detailed feature engineering pipeline (thresholding, knn imputing, normalizing, etc)
+ Trained, resampled, and tuned hyperparameters for LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, then evaluating models on test data
+ Utilized variable importance to understand top predictors across models (one of my created feature ranked highest)
